# Test Suite Status Report

Generated: 2025-08-03

## Overview

Total Tests in Suite: 249
- Based on TEST_EXECUTION_REPORT.md breakdown
- Actual test count varies due to implementation differences

## Current Test Results

### ✅ Passing Tests

#### Unit Tests (76/80 = 95%)
- ✅ BaseParticipant tests: All passing
- ✅ HumanParticipant tests: All passing  
- ✅ NLWebParticipant tests: 8/10 passing
- ✅ Schemas tests: Most passing
- ✅ Storage tests: Most passing

#### E2E Tests - Real Implementation (7/7 = 100%)
File: `tests/e2e/test_multi_participant_real.py`
- ✅ test_create_send_receive_conversation_cycle
- ✅ test_single_user_multiple_messages
- ✅ test_three_humans_scenario
- ✅ test_participant_join_during_active_conversation
- ✅ test_participant_leave_and_rejoin
- ✅ test_many_participants
- ✅ test_create_chat_leave_lifecycle

### ❌ Failing Tests

#### Unit Tests (4 failures)
1. `TestNLWebParticipant::test_queue_full_handling` - Queue full error not raised
2. `TestMultiParticipantScenarios::test_context_includes_appropriate_history_from_all` - Context building issue
3. `TestConversation::test_conversation_serialization` - Serialization format mismatch
4. `TestConversationCache::test_memory_pressure_handling` - Cache eviction not working

#### Integration Tests (35/37 failing)
- All integration tests use mock approach and need to be rewritten
- Only 2 tests passing (network timeout and one skipped test)

#### E2E Tests - Old Implementation (11/11 failing) 
File: `tests/e2e/test_multi_participant.py`
- Tests expect REST endpoints that don't exist (`/chat/{id}/message`)
- Tests use old mock-based approach
- Share link functionality not implemented

#### Performance Tests (Not fully tested)
- Some basic benchmarks pass
- Most performance tests fail due to missing infrastructure

#### Security Tests (Not tested)
- Require security infrastructure setup

#### Reliability Tests (Not tested)  
- Require reliability testing infrastructure

## Key Issues to Address

### 1. Integration Tests Need Rewrite
All integration tests in `tests/integration/` use the mock approach with `aioresponses`. They need to be rewritten to use real server like we did for E2E tests.

### 2. Old E2E Tests Need Update
The original E2E tests in `test_multi_participant.py` expect endpoints that don't exist:
- `POST /chat/{id}/message` - Not implemented (messages sent via WebSocket)
- Share link functionality - Not implemented

### 3. Missing Test Infrastructure
- Performance test harness
- Security test framework
- Reliability/chaos testing setup

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Rewrite Integration Tests**: Convert from mocks to real server testing
2. **Update Old E2E Tests**: Either update expectations or mark as future features
3. **Fix Unit Test Failures**: Address the 4 failing unit tests

### Future Work
1. **Implement Missing Features**:
   - Share link generation and usage
   - REST endpoint for sending messages (if needed)
   - Rate limiting and security features

2. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Set up performance testing framework
   - Add security testing tools
   - Create reliability testing harness

## Summary

**Current State**: 
- Core functionality is working (7/7 real E2E tests pass)
- Unit tests are mostly passing (95%)
- Integration tests need major rework
- Missing some advanced features

**Path Forward**:
1. Fix the 4 failing unit tests
2. Rewrite integration tests to use real server
3. Update or defer old E2E tests for missing features
4. Set up proper test infrastructure for performance/security/reliability
